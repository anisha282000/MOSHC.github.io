# MOSHC (Mozilla Open Source Hack Club)

This is a Mozilla Open source contributor Community club for Mozillian in Uttrakhand.
We're here to help you if you're new at open source and seeking for opportunities which help you to become familiar with open source.
It brings people together locally to teach, protect and build the open web in an engaging and collaborative way.
This is an exciting time for us to unite our network of passionate contributors and create new opportunities for collaboration, learning, and growth within our Mozillian communities.
